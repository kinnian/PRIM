School project on bosonic codes in pure-loss channel for Télécom ParisTech.

Based on the paper _Performance and structure of bosonic codes_ by Victor V. Albert, Kyungjoo Noh, Kasper Duivenvoorden et al, I try to give a visual representation of the code states of the various code class studied. I use mainly the Wigner plot representation to have a clear and nice visual representation. In order to check the accuracy of the representation, I plot the trace distance between those states and the vacuum -- the pure-loss channel contracts phase space to the vacuum so they should get closer -- and the overlap of the two logical states, using the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.

Although I obtain a nice visual representation, the plots other than the Wigner function show unexpected results I cannot explain.
